# zalde-map-builder
## Project
This is a map builder for zelda-like games.
It features an interface to choose which tile to put in each place, and lets you export it as a map file.
It also lets you modify existing map files.

## Map files
Map files must follow a very specific pattern.
It is described in the image below :

## Technologies
We used SDL2 for the GUI.
